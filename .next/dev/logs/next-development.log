[00:13:14.968] Browser ERROR   ./app/page.tsx:6:1
Export ContactSection doesn't exist in target module
  4 | import { MenuSection } from "@/components/menu-section"
  5 | import { TestimonialsSection } from "@/components/testimonials-section"

  7 | import { Navbar } from "@/components/navbar"
  8 | import { Footer } from "@/components/footer"
  9 | import { AOSInitializer } from "@/components/aos-initializer"

The export ContactSection was not found in module [project]/components/contact-section.tsx [app-rsc] (ecmascript).
The module has no exports at all.
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.
